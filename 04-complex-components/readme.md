# Complex components
- we cannot use class in the custom tags. Instead of **class** we have to use **className**
- child component: A child component is a component which is inside of another component
- parent component: A parent component is a component which hase one or multiple child components
- you can write comments in react by {/**/}

# Properties
- react allows us to send data to he component by he same syntax like HTML
- attributes / properties on a component
- inside of the component we can access props as this.props

# Misc
- don't let components be really big
- they van be brake apart (easier to test and add functionality)
